## Development

- Initial setup: _If you just pull this project_

  ```sh
  create a .env file and copy .env.example content in it
  ```

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `sacha.ketchum@pkmn.com`
- Password: `pikapika`
